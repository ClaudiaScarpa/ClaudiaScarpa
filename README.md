# Hi, I'm Claudia Scarpa 👋

I am a Graduate Mathematics Student at the **University of Bologna**, specializing in **Advanced Mathematics for Applications**. My core interest lies at the intersection of **Stochastic Processes**, **Optimization**, and **Quantitative Modeling**.

### 🔭 Current & Upcoming Focus
* **Operations Research Intern @ Optit**: Applying mathematical programming and optimization algorithms to solve complex industrial problems.
* **Quantitative Research Aspirations**: Interested in leveraging stochastic calculus, game theory, and statistical modeling to solve financial and economic challenges.

### 📊 Mathematical & Technical Expertise
* **Advanced Math:** Stochastic Processes, Mean Field Games, Combinatorial Analysis, Game Theory.
* **Programming:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy), MATLAB, Java.
* **Tools:** LaTeX, Git, Excel.

### 🎓 Key Educational Milestones
* **MSc in Mathematics** - University of Bologna (Ongoing).
* **Summer School for Economics and Social Sciences** - *Mathematics Research Center "Ennio De Giorgi"*. Intensive coursework on **Mean Field Games** and **Combinatorial Stochastic Processes** with applications in Finance.
* **BSc in Mathematics** - University of Trento.

### ♟️ Analytical Mindset
Beyond mathematics, I am a **Competitive Chess Player** and two-time Italian Youth Champion. I apply the same strategic depth, pattern recognition, and pressure-handling required at the chessboard to my quantitative research projects.
